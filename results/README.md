This folder shoudl contain a set of notebooks which visualize data that is in the `processed_data` folder.
The notebooks *SHOULD NOT* process data themselves but simply present it. Any processing should be done in 
the `code` folder. The notebooks themselves should have figure captions.

This file should describe each notebook as well as create a thread through each one of
the analyses.

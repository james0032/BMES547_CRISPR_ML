# Discription of raw data
The tar ball contains the off-target sites observed by CIRCLE-seq, GUIDE-seq. Lists of sequence with no more than 6 mismatches were retrieved using cas-offinder in GRCh37. 

** Note: the TRUE NEGATIVE INSTANCE has to be done by getting the UNIQUE list of *.ALL.csv compared with CIRCLE-seq/GUIDE-seq results; in another word, one should excludes the off-target sites observed by CIRCLE-seq/GUIDE-seq to acquire the TRUE NEGATIVE INSTANCE.


This includes meta-data like:
  - Source (person, website, experiment)
  - Any relevant version info
  - Date
  - Any hand-processing required
